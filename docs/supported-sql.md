# Supported SQL

The canonical reference for the SQL surface SQLRite implements today. Parsing is delegated to [`sqlparser`](https://crates.io/crates/sqlparser) using the SQLite dialect, so tokens and grammar follow SQLite — execution only implements the subset below, and anything else is rejected with a typed `NotImplemented` error rather than silently partial behavior.

If you're looking for _how_ to use SQLRite (REPL flow, meta-commands, history, embedding), see [Using SQLRite](usage.md). This document is the strict reference for what statements execute and what semantics they carry.

## Statement at a glance

| Statement | Supported today |
|---|---|
| [`CREATE TABLE`](#create-table) | Columns with `PRIMARY KEY` / `UNIQUE` / `NOT NULL`; typed columns; auto-indexes on constrained columns |
| [`CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX`](#create-index) | Single-column named indexes, `IF NOT EXISTS`, persisted as cell-based B-Trees |
| [`INSERT INTO`](#insert-into) | Auto-ROWID, UNIQUE/PK enforcement, clean type errors, NULL padding |
| [`SELECT`](#select) | `*` or column list, `WHERE`, single-column `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`; index probing on `col = literal` |
| [`UPDATE`](#update) | Multi-column `SET`, `WHERE`, arithmetic RHS, type + UNIQUE enforcement |
| [`DELETE`](#delete) | `WHERE` predicate or whole-table |
| [`BEGIN`](#transactions) / [`COMMIT`](#transactions) / [`ROLLBACK`](#transactions) | Snapshot-based; single-level; WAL-backed commit; auto-rollback on COMMIT disk failure |

Statements the parser accepts (because sqlparser understands them in the SQLite dialect) but SQLRite doesn't execute yet return `SQL Statement not supported yet`. The [Not yet supported](#not-yet-supported) section below enumerates the common ones.

---

## `CREATE TABLE`

```sql
CREATE TABLE <name> (<col> <type> [column_constraint]* [, ...]);
```

### Column types

| Keyword(s) | Storage class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INTEGER`, `INT`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT` | Integer (i64) | All four alias to the same 64-bit signed storage class |
| `TEXT`, `VARCHAR` | Text (String) | UTF-8; no length limit enforced (VARCHAR's `(n)` is parsed and ignored) |
| `REAL`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL` | Real (f64) | Double-precision; `DECIMAL(p,s)` precision/scale parsed and ignored |
| `BOOLEAN` | Boolean | Stored compactly in the null bitmap's sibling bits; accepts `TRUE` / `FALSE` |
| `VECTOR(N)` | Vector (Vec\<f32\>, fixed dim N) | **Phase 7a.** Dense f32 array of fixed dimension. `N` is required and must be ≥ 1. Inserted as bracket-array literals `[0.1, 0.2, ...]`. Dimension is enforced at INSERT/UPDATE; mismatched-length values are rejected. Distance functions and ANN indexing land in 7b–7d. |

### Column constraints

- `PRIMARY KEY` — one column per table; the column **must** be `INTEGER` and gets auto-ROWID behavior (omitted on INSERT → auto-assigned). Auto-creates an index named `sqlrite_autoindex_<table>_<column>`.
- `UNIQUE` — enforced at INSERT/UPDATE time. Auto-creates an index with the same naming scheme.
- `NOT NULL` — rejects NULL at INSERT/UPDATE. Omitted columns on INSERT are NULL by default, so a `NOT NULL` without an INSERT-time value is an error.

### What's **not** enforced at CREATE TABLE time

- **Table-level constraints** (`PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2)`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, `UNIQUE (col1, col2)`) are parsed but ignored.
- **`DEFAULT` values** are parsed but ignored.
- **Multi-column `PRIMARY KEY`** — only single-column PKs work; a composite PK is accepted by the parser but treated as no PK.

### Errors returned

- `Table 'foo' already exists.` — duplicate `CREATE TABLE`.
- `'sqlrite_master' is a reserved name used by the internal schema catalog` — you tried to shadow the catalog table.
- `Column 'foo' appears more than once in the table definition` — duplicate column names.
- `PRIMARY KEY column must be INTEGER` — PK on a non-integer column.

---

## `CREATE INDEX`

```sql
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <name> ON <table> (<column>);
```

- Single-column only. Composite indexes (`CREATE INDEX ... ON t (a, b)`) are parsed but rejected at execution.
- The index name is **required**. Anonymous (`CREATE INDEX ON t (col)`) is rejected with `anonymous indexes are not supported`.
- Supported column types: `INTEGER`, `TEXT`. `REAL` and `BOOLEAN` columns cannot be indexed yet.
- `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` on a column whose existing rows already carry duplicate values is rejected before any change is made — the table + other indexes stay untouched.
- `IF NOT EXISTS` — skips the create if an index with that name already exists. No-op return value in that case.
- Indexes persist as their own cell-based B-Trees (see [Storage model](storage-model.md)).

### Auto-indexes

Every `PRIMARY KEY` and every `UNIQUE` column gets an auto-index at `CREATE TABLE` time:

```
sqlrite_autoindex_<table>_<column>
```

These are full-citizen indexes — they're visible via `.tables`-adjacent catalog queries (once those land), persist across saves, and accelerate equality probes. You don't need to `CREATE INDEX` them yourself.

---

## `INSERT INTO`

```sql
INSERT INTO <name> (col1, col2, ...) VALUES (v1, v2, ...)
                                  [, (v1, v2, ...) ...];
```

- **Explicit column list is required.** Value-list-only inserts (`INSERT INTO t VALUES (...)`) are not supported yet.
- **`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` auto-ROWID** — omit the PK column and a ROWID is auto-assigned (max existing + 1, starting at 1).
- **Multi-row inserts** — the parser accepts `VALUES (...), (...), (...)`, and SQLRite runs each row through the type + UNIQUE checks in order. A failure mid-batch leaves the already-inserted rows in place.
- **NULL padding** — columns not named in the column list default to NULL. `NOT NULL` columns must appear in the list (or be the omitted PK).
- **Type validation** happens at INSERT time. A mismatched literal (`INSERT INTO t (age) VALUES ('not-a-number')` where `age` is `INTEGER`) is rejected with a typed error — no panic, no partial write.
- **UNIQUE enforcement** runs *before* any row insert so a failing batch doesn't leave partial state.

### Value literals accepted

| Literal | Example |
|---|---|
| Integer | `42`, `-5`, `0` |
| Real | `3.14`, `-0.001`, `1e10` |
| Text | `'single-quoted'` — doubled single quotes escape: `'it''s'` |
| Boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` (case-insensitive) |
| NULL | `NULL` (case-insensitive) |
| Vector | `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]` — JSON-style bracket-array; integer elements widen to f32 (`[1, 2, 3]` is valid). For `VECTOR(N)` columns; dimension must match the declared `N`. *(Phase 7a)* |

Hex literals, blob literals, and date/time functions are not supported.

---

## `SELECT`

```sql
SELECT {* | col1, col2, ...}
FROM <table>
  [WHERE <expr>]
  [ORDER BY <col> [ASC|DESC]]
  [LIMIT <non-negative-integer>];
```

### What works

- **Projection**: `*` (all columns in declaration order) or a bare column list. Columns not declared on the table are rejected.
- **`WHERE`**: any [expression](#expressions). Evaluated per row; NULL-as-false in WHERE context (three-valued logic collapsed to two-valued for filtering).
- **`ORDER BY`**: single sort key, `ASC` (default) or `DESC`. The sort key can be a bare column reference OR any expression — including function calls — so KNN queries like `ORDER BY vec_distance_l2(embedding, [...]) LIMIT k` work end-to-end *(Phase 7b)*. Sort key types must match; mixing `INTEGER` and `TEXT` across rows under a single `ORDER BY` is a runtime error.
- **`LIMIT`**: non-negative integer literal. `LIMIT 0` is valid (returns zero rows).

### Index probing

The executor includes a tiny optimizer: if the `WHERE` is exactly `<indexed_col> = <literal>` or `<literal> = <indexed_col>`, it probes the index and scans only matching rows. Mixed predicates (`WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2`), range predicates (`WHERE a > 1`), and OR-combined predicates fall back to a full table scan.

### What doesn't work

- **Joins** of any kind (`INNER`, `LEFT OUTER`, `CROSS`, comma-join)
- **Subqueries**, CTEs (`WITH`), views
- **`GROUP BY`**, aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`), `HAVING`
- **`DISTINCT`**
- **`LIKE`**, **`IN`**, **`IS NULL`** / **`IS NOT NULL`**, `BETWEEN`
- **Expressions in the projection list** (`SELECT age + 1 FROM users`) — projection is bare column references only
- **Multi-column `ORDER BY`**, `NULLS FIRST/LAST` (single sort key only; the sort key itself can be an expression as of Phase 7b)
- **`OFFSET`**
- **Column aliases** (`SELECT name AS n FROM users`)

Any of the above reaches the executor as a parsed AST node that execution doesn't handle, producing either `NotImplemented` or a more specific error (e.g., `joins are not supported`).

---

## `UPDATE`

```sql
UPDATE <table> SET col1 = <expr> [, col2 = <expr>]* [WHERE <expr>];
```

- **Multi-column `SET`** — separate assignments with commas.
- **RHS is a full expression** — can reference other columns of the same row:
  ```sql
  UPDATE users SET age = age + 1, updated_at = 'now' WHERE id = 42;
  ```
- **Type enforcement** — the declared column type of each target is checked against the assigned expression's result. Mismatch is a clean error; the row (and all other rows that would have been updated by the same statement) stays untouched.
- **UNIQUE enforcement** — if the update would collide with another row's value on a UNIQUE / PRIMARY KEY column, the whole statement is rejected before any write. No partial updates.
- **NULL assignments** respect `NOT NULL` — `SET col = NULL` on a `NOT NULL` column errors.

---

## `DELETE`

```sql
DELETE FROM <table> [WHERE <expr>];
```

- **No `WHERE`** deletes every row (tables and indexes are preserved; only row data is removed).
- **`WHERE`** uses the same [expression](#expressions) evaluator as `SELECT`.
- Secondary indexes are updated alongside the row deletes so a subsequent `WHERE col = ...` doesn't return stale hits.

---

## Expressions

Expressions work inside `WHERE` (both in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) and on the right-hand side of `UPDATE`'s `SET`.

### Operators

| Category | Operators |
|---|---|
| Comparison | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| Logical | `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` |
| String | `\|\|` (concatenation) |
| Unary | `+`, `-` |
| Grouping | Parentheses |

### Literals

Same set accepted by `INSERT` (see [Value literals accepted](#value-literals-accepted)).

### Built-in functions

| Function | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vec_distance_l2(a, b)` | Real (f64) | Euclidean distance √Σ(aᵢ−bᵢ)². Smaller is closer. *(Phase 7b)* |
| `vec_distance_cosine(a, b)` | Real (f64) | Cosine distance `1 − (a·b) / (‖a‖·‖b‖)`. Errors on zero-magnitude vectors (cosine is undefined). Smaller is closer; identical vectors return 0.0, orthogonal vectors return 1.0. *(Phase 7b)* |
| `vec_distance_dot(a, b)` | Real (f64) | Negated dot product `−(a·b)`. Negation makes "smaller is closer" consistent with the others. For unit-norm vectors equals `vec_distance_cosine(a, b) - 1`. *(Phase 7b)* |

All three vector-distance functions take exactly two arguments, both of which must be vectors of the same dimension. Either argument can be a column reference (`embedding`), a bracket-array literal (`[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`), or any sub-expression that evaluates to a vector. Mismatched dimensions error with `vector dimensions don't match (lhs=N, rhs=M)`.

The KNN ranking pattern that motivates this set:

```sql
SELECT id, title FROM docs
ORDER BY vec_distance_l2(embedding, [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.0])
LIMIT 10;
```

> **Operator forms (`<->` `<=>` `<#>`) are not supported yet.** They're the de facto pgvector convention but blocked on a sqlparser limitation — will land as a Phase 7b.1 follow-up. Use the function-call form for now.

### Type coercion in arithmetic

- **Integer-only ops stay integer.** `1 + 2` → `3` (Integer).
- **Any `REAL` operand promotes to `f64`.** `1 + 2.0` → `3.0` (Real).
- **Divide/modulo by zero** returns a typed runtime error rather than panicking: `division by zero` for `/` and `%`.
- **`TEXT` in arithmetic context** errors — `'hello' + 1` is not silently coerced.

### NULL handling

SQLRite follows standard SQL three-valued logic:

- **Comparisons involving NULL** (`NULL = 1`, `1 < NULL`) evaluate to unknown, which behaves as `false` inside `WHERE`. Neither the NULL = NULL equality nor the NULL <> NULL inequality is true — use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` for explicit null tests (both **not yet supported**).
- **Logical operators with NULL**: `NULL AND false` → `false`, `NULL AND true` → `NULL`, `NULL OR true` → `true`, `NOT NULL` → `NULL`. The short-circuit rules prevent NULL from propagating when one operand already decides the result.
- **Arithmetic with NULL**: any operand NULL → result NULL. `NULL + 1` → `NULL`.
- **String concat with NULL**: `'foo' || NULL` → `NULL` (same propagation as arithmetic).

### Case sensitivity

- **Keywords** (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `AND`, `TRUE`, `NULL`, …) are case-insensitive. `select`, `SELECT`, `SeLeCt` all parse.
- **Identifiers** (table names, column names) are **case-sensitive** — no normalization is applied at definition or lookup time. `CREATE TABLE Users (…)` followed by `SELECT * FROM users` fails with `Table doesn't exist`. (This is the opposite of SQLite's default; we'll revisit once the cursor refactor in Phase 5 lands.)
- **String literals** preserve case: `'Alice'` stays `Alice`.

---

## Transactions

```sql
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('alice');
  UPDATE counters SET n = n + 1 WHERE name = 'signups';
COMMIT;
```

Or:

```sql
BEGIN;
  DELETE FROM users WHERE banned = TRUE;
ROLLBACK;  -- nothing was actually deleted
```

### Semantics

- **`BEGIN`** deep-clones the in-memory database into a snapshot held on `db.txn`. Auto-save is **suppressed** while the transaction is open — mutations accumulate in memory.
- **`COMMIT`** flushes every accumulated change to the WAL in one atomic commit frame and drops the snapshot. Readers of the file after COMMIT see all of the transaction's changes at once.
- **`ROLLBACK`** replaces the live state with the snapshot and drops the snapshot. Nothing hits disk.

### Details that matter

- **Nested `BEGIN` is rejected** with `a transaction is already open`. No savepoints yet.
- **`BEGIN` on a read-only database** (`sqlrite --readonly foo.sqlrite`) is rejected with `cannot execute: database is opened read-only`.
- **Runtime errors mid-transaction do NOT auto-rollback.** If an `INSERT` fails inside a transaction (UNIQUE violation, type mismatch, bad syntax), the transaction stays open. The caller decides whether to `ROLLBACK` or `COMMIT` whatever succeeded before the failure.
- **`COMMIT`'s disk write failing DOES auto-rollback.** If the save at COMMIT time errors (disk full, permission denied, checksum mismatch), SQLRite restores the pre-BEGIN snapshot and surfaces `COMMIT failed — transaction rolled back: <underlying error>`. Leaving in-flight mutations live after a failed COMMIT would be unsafe — any subsequent non-transactional statement's auto-save would silently publish partial work.
- **Cost**: `BEGIN` is `O(N)` in the total size of the in-memory database because of the snapshot clone. On a huge database, opening a transaction just to run a single read-only query is wasteful — use a plain `SELECT` instead.
- **Visibility to other processes**: with POSIX file locks (Phase 4a–4e), a writer excludes all concurrent readers anyway, so "uncommitted transaction state leaking to a concurrent reader" isn't a concern — no concurrent reader exists during an open transaction.

---

## Read-only databases

A REPL launched with `sqlrite --readonly foo.sqlrite` (or `sqlrite::open_database_read_only(path, name)` programmatically) takes a shared POSIX advisory lock instead of an exclusive one. In that mode:

- `SELECT` works normally.
- Every write statement (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`) is rejected **before** touching memory with `cannot execute: database is opened read-only`. The in-memory state never diverges from disk.
- `BEGIN` is rejected.
- Multiple read-only openers of the same file coexist (shared flock). Any read-write opener blocks all read-only openers and vice versa — POSIX's "many readers OR one writer, not both" semantics.

---

## Statement-level rules

- **One statement per call** — `process_command` / `Connection::execute` expects a single statement. Multi-statement strings (`"INSERT …; INSERT …;"`) are rejected with `Expected a single query statement, but there are N`. For multi-statement execution, use the SDK's `executescript` / `execute_batch` helpers (Phases 5c/5d).
- **Trailing semicolons** are optional. Both `SELECT 1` and `SELECT 1;` parse.
- **Empty / comment-only input** is a benign no-op — no error, no auto-save triggered.
- **Multi-line statements** work. The REPL (via rustyline) buffers continuation lines until a terminating semicolon is seen.

---

## Not yet supported

For context when you hit `NotImplemented`. See [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for when these land:
