`Rust-SQLite`, aka `SQLRite` , is a simple embedded database modeled off `SQLite`, but developed with `Rust`. The goal is get a better understanding of database internals by building one.

### Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Rust (latest stable) – [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

### Usage (TBD)

```shell
> ./rust_sqlite -- help
SQLRite 0.1.0
Joao Henrique Machado Silva <joaoh82@gmail.com>
Light version of SQLite developed with Rust

USAGE:
    rust_sqlite

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
```

### Project Progress
*Not checked means I am currently working on.*
- [x] CLI and REPL Interface
- [x] Parse meta commands and sql commands.
- [x] Execute simple commands
- [x] Standarized error handling
- [x] Generic validation structure for SQL Commands.
- [x] `Create Table` Command Parsing
- [x] Improve error handling with https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror
- [x] Added support for parsing duplicate columns on CREATE TABLE
- [x] Added support for parsing multiple PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE
- [x] In memory BTreeMap indexes initially only for PRIMARY KEYS.
- [x] Simple INSERT queries command parsing.
- [x] Implementation UNIQUE key constraints.
- [ ] Improve Error Handling and return without Panic!
- [ ] Simple SELECT queries (Single WHERE clause and no JOINS).
- [ ] Serialization | Deserialization to and from binary encodings ([bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode)).


### Roadmap
Features that are in the roadmap of the project:

*Ideally in order of priority, but nothing set in stone.*


- [ ] Implement Open command to load database with a command `.open`
- [ ] Joins
  - [ ] INNER JOIN (or sometimes called simple join)
  - [ ] LEFT OUTER JOIN (or sometimes called LEFT JOIN)
  - [ ] CROSS JOIN
  - The RIGHT OUTER JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN are not supported in SQLite.
- [ ] WAL - Write Ahead Log Implementation
- [ ] `Pager Module` 
  - [ ] Implementing transactional ACID properties
  - [ ] Concurrency
  - [ ] Lock Manager
- [ ] Composite Indexing - cost and performance gain analysis
- [ ] Benchmarking vs SQLite for comparison
- [ ] Server Client / Connection Manager
- [ ] Different implementations of storage engines and data structures to optimize for different scenarios
  - [ ] Write Heavy - `LSM Tree && SSTable`
  - [ ] Read Heavy - `B-Tree`
